# bamazon-CLI
B amazon is a shopping command line application develop using Node.js with MYSQL.  I used the npm package inquier to provide the user with the different prompts.  This application has three different views: 1) Customer View 2)Manager View and 3) Supervisor View.

Customer View:  
When the customer places an order, the application checks inventory and either fulfills the request or provides a message to the user letting them know if the request cannot be filled due to low inventory.   The application is menu driven and the user can exit the application at anytime in the process.

Manager View: provides a list of options to 1) View Products | 2) View Low Inventory | 3)Add to Existing Inventory | 4) Add New Product | 5) Exit the Application.

Supervisor View:   The supervisor can view all product sales infromation.  Including Overhead Cost, Total Profit and Product Sales.  They also have the ability to add new departments to the store.

Screenshots can be found in the screenshot directory of this repository.
